 AUS_Compromise_Achieved: "The Compromise Achieved"
 AUS_Compromise_Achieved_desc: "Due to the handling of the situation, Franz Joseph managed to stop further unrest from plauging the already exhuasted empire. However, a compromise was founded in these hard times, which, for the better or worse, has established Hungary as a equal of Austria, with Franz Joseph now reining as Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary respectively.\n\nReactions are mixed within the Dual Monarchy, but one thing is sure: Austria, Hungary and their loyal subjects will advance together in these hard times."

 AUS_HUN_December_Constitution: "The December Constitution "
 AUS_HUN_December_Constitution_desc: "It is no secret that the empire has, under some unfortunate circumstances, been forced to adapt. However, we must make with what we have, and as per the requests of the Liberal faction, we have begun to establish a new constitution. While some might protest the decision, Franz Joseph is forced to limit his power, or risk backlash from the rapidly rising Liberals.\n\nHow we handle the creation of it is up to us, but we will need to allow for equality between all the minorities to be established, and the creation of somewhat autonomous entities. Furthermore, the Imperial Council shall take up some duties from Franz Joseph, slowly abolishing the Autocracy of our nation."
 AUS_HUN_Bourgeois_Cabinet: "The Bourgeois Cabinet"
 AUS_HUN_Bourgeois_Cabinet_desc: "With the establishment of the December constitution, which saw many Liberal reforms enacted, the popularity of the Liberal faction within the Imperial government has rapidly expanded, and it seems as if the days of the Aristocratic cabinet is numbered. While Franz-Joseph is not supportive of the Reformists, it would be best to promote progressivism, and to advance our society forward.\n\nCount Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, along with several other Liberals, Reformists and Progressives, are to form a new cabinet to stabilize the situation of the Dual-Monarchy."
 AUS_HUN_Abrogate_Concordat: "Abrogate the Concordat"
 AUS_HUN_Abrogate_Concordat_desc: "The Concordat of 1855 during its implementation was relatively popular, marking reconciliation with the Catholic church, and letting said church sway power over Marriages, Censorship and Education. While it may have served the interests of the Clergy and Absolutists, it certainly did not of the average citizen of the Empire.\n\nAs the Dual-Monarchy is slowly turning more reformist, we come to the issue of the Concordat. While some of its laws could be intergrated into the December Constitution, it as a concept will be abolished. This will also see the implementation of eventual Secular Education and the restoration of Civil Marriages."

 AUS_HUN_Galician_Sejm_desc: "While many would like to see the abolishment of Habsburg authority in the Dual-Monarchy, there still remain some ethnicities loyal to us. The Polish, mostly within the Governorate of Galicia-Lodomeria have proved themselves loyal to far, and remain a royalist stronghold. Such loyalty cannot go unnoticed, and with the Liberals establishing their own cabinet, we will take up action to reward our subjects.\n\nThe Polish are to be given self-governance to establish the Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria, which will act similar to the Hungarians, albeit remaining under the Austrian empire. A regional parliament, known as "Sejm" will be established, to take up concerns of the Polish regions and put them forward to Vienna."
